# B&B notes 14-02-2025

Present:
Tijmen, Tycho, Stephanie, Brett, Sophie, Meron

Agenda:
Discuss how to continue Bytes&Bites after departure Stephanie and Meron

## Future meet-ups

**Observation**

Most time in planning B&B is preparing the program.

**Many suggestions made:**

- less often meet-ups
- schedule further in advance
- no pizza to make registration less needed and organization easier

- Brett, Tijmen, Kostas and Sophie are not able to invest time in organizing program.
- Tycho can facilitate snacks, location and inviting people to come to the meeting. But can not create a research software related program.

- Idea to combine Data Conversations with B&B somehow
- Idea to have a low-effort coding cafe where people only go to code and see like-minded people --> this was discarded as some more incentive is needed for people to come.
- Idea to send a short survey around (e.g. is pizza important for you? what is the main use of B&B for you?)
- Shorter B&B (e.g. 16:00 - 17:00) or different time (e.g. at lunch)

## Conclusions

Two scenarios on  how to continue, based on availability of organizers:

- Put B&B on hold until new UB RSE+community manager are hired
- Have a B&B walk-in hour with ITvO in the lead
