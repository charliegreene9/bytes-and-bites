### Theme: Version Control

[Register](https://vu-nl.libcal.com/event/4276065)

Join us for the next engaging session of Bytes & Bites where will talk about being in control of your coding, jumping back to better times, and collaborating with others on a programming challenge. We will use Git and train with GitHub as an example platform. 

You do not need to bring your own dataset for the practical part. Instead, we will challenge you with a TidyTuesday dataset about the most important thing for a researcher: [Coffee](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-05-14/readme.md)
We can be creative, work together in teams and have some tasty pizza and snacks.
