Stackoverflow being a place where people freely share their knowledge and experience and the large number of open github repos and opensource projects should make that clear.\n\n“if I have seen further [than others], it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” - Isaac Newton\n\nTo keep us on top of those metaphorical shoulders we have compiled a list of useful or interesting tools, scripts, and frameworks that are free to use. Happy coding!\nSimple Python template is a project template for simple Python projects that we have developed primarily for researchers. This template is easy to setup and use and is intended to keep your code clean, readable, and secure. It is a work in progress and there are two other standard types to come - “Shared code” and “Package or Software”. Similar templates will also be developed for other languages such as R.\nF-UJI provides a service to automate the FAIR assessment of datasets. The service uses the DOI or URL of your datasets to measure it against the FAIR metrics as defined by the FAIRSFAIR project. As ever take privacy and security into account whenever uploading anything to the internet. Any projects with sensitive data should be appropriately cleaned, anonymised, or pseudonymised.\nJan - “Jan is an open source ChatGPT-alternative that runs 100% offline.” It is a a GUI to interact a selection of open source LLM models from the Hugging Face repository. It works in the same familiar chatbot manner and is available on all major operating systems.\nOpenRefine, an open source tool for data manipulation. Clean, change format, add connected data sources, cluster editing, filtered functions, and more. If you have questions or get stuck there is an active community that can help or if you want to use some of the features directly in your own code you can, provided you respect their license agreement.\ndeploy2zenodo - a shell script to deploy files to Zenodo that can be used as part of a CI pipeline meaning it can be an automatic part of your development process.\nCFF INIT is a web tool for creating or updating CITATION.cff files. If you aren’t already including citation instructions in your software this could be the way to get started!\nTAXILA - a scraping service that finds courses, workshops, events, learning materials, and trainers from 37 different partner institutions in the Netherlands. You can create an account and subscribe to get alerts on the information that interests you or if you prefer curate your own list with the RSS feed or via their API.\nErsilia has a CLI (command line interface) download that allows you to download and directly use any of their open source ML models for Chemistry straight out of the box.\nEUROPEAN ALTERNATIVES - a website with European digital services and products as alternatives for their American counterparts. They are categorised for ease of browsing and you can also try searching for products or services you already use to find the suggested alternatives.\nOh My Git! - an open source game built in Godot to help you learn Git. A fun and interactive way to learn Git intended for beginners, but with plenty of tricks more advanced users might not know.\nPositron - an R IDE from the makers of RStudio is a modern revamp of that same IDE you know and love. The integrated features and marketplace mindset for extensions of VS code meets the familiarity and accessiblity of RStudio.\n\nVisual Programming\nOrange - A python based visual programming tool from the University of Ljubljana that is used for everything from data cleaning, to visualisation, to classification models. Straightforward to use and with easy to understand lessons on youtube. Developing your own widgets and add-ons is also possible.\nRed-R - An R based visual programming tool developed by Anup Parikh and Kyle Covington. Sadly it is no longer maintained, but it could still be a useful intro to programming in R for some.\nFME - A paid no code software solution. It has an active community that develop new tools and features and share them at summits and conferences. It also has the possibility to deploy on their servers to setup scheduled runs.\nScratch - A visual programming language made by MIT to introduce children and newcomers to programming. It is a great way to help you understand the logic of programming. A very active community that typically uses the tool to make games. Nice docs here.\nBlockly - The Google made competitor to Scratch, again the target audience is children and newcomers, but there are capabilities for easy deployment and embedding into your own website. They have games to learn how to use it and the concepts.\n\n\nSpecial mention: Open source tools\nJasp - R based SPSS replacement developed by a team at the UvA. It is still in development, but a functional version is available.\nAntTools - A set of open source tools for text analysis made by Lawrence Anthony."

The materials are grouped by topic starting with general sources - places that cover everything in a reasonably clear and explanatory way. Please refer to these materials if you cannot find anything in our documentation or want to start on your learning journey in your own time. Do remember that while we endeavour to make sure that our own guides are comprehensive and clear it can always help to give a further understanding of topic when reviewing it from multiple angles. In addition, programming is a solution to a puzzle and the puzzles always have multiple solutions. So, while our solution (methods) might not suit your style, perhaps someone else’s does.\nIf you come across any sources not in this list that you think could be useful, please reach out and contact the team via the contribution portal and we will review it for adding to the list.\n\n\nIf you are looking for additional sessions to Bytes & Bites you can perhaps find support in the codebar sessions though do note that as a student “workshops and events are exclusively for women, non-binary, LGBTQ+ members (mirrored also in the rainborR buddy programme), and people from underrepresented minority groups”. They do however upload their talks to their youtube channel, much like PyData (talks mostly on data analysis in various languages).\n\n\n\nThere are many places peddling their coding courses these days, however there are still plenty of good quality free courses. In general you can find everything you need to learn for free in one way or another, including interactive courses.\n\n\n\nSwirl – R – An R package that teaches you to code in line. Install the package, call upon it and follow the instructions. There are also websites to help with solutions when you are stuck. MIT OpenCourseWare – All – MIT has a series of free courses from introductory to intermediate. You can pay if you want your work marked and to get a certificate, otherwise it is not needed. W3Schools – All – A site with free courses for all sorts of programming languages that also has embedded coding playgrounds, tests, questions, and cheatsheets. OSSU Compsci course - Mixed - A (mostly) free comprehensive computer science course from mixed resources with a community for discussion, questions, and trouble shooting. RSQKit – Overview – Provides an overview of best coding practices in science including (but not limited to) management, citation, sharing code, and pipelines.\n\n\n\nThere are many places to find coding courses, here are a few popular ones:\nCodecademy: A site that has both paid course and free articles/guides. Ignore the courses you can find some good information in their articles, though perhaps not the best place to get it. Datacamp: The Etos to the Kruidvat that is Codecademy. Stick to the articles and look elsewhere for courses or topics if you don’t want to pay. Coursera: Essentially a course marketplace, be sure to read the reviews and check that the topics are relevant. There are free courses or some that provide a free option of their course that is a limited version of the paid one. edX: A more refined course marketplace intially started by a US university collective. The courses vary greatly in length (days to years) and cost (free to 10s of thousands of euros), again it is worth checking the reviews before signing up to one.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of places to discuss programming and majority of mixed forums (or social media) will have sections to discuss programming these days.
