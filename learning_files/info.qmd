The research software community can be fragmented and resources can be spread with sadly little knowledge about them.
This page is to shine the light on some resources from the VU and others in the field of research support.

The [RDM Handbook]() from the UBVU has short articles covering both data and software knowledge, services, tools, and 
guidelines within the VU.
